Assignment Description:

Build a text-based story game where the player travels the paths in your story.
For each point in your story, a text and / or image should be presented to the player and he or she should be given one, two or three choices.
The choice takes the player further (or back) on a path in the story.
Start by deciding what the game is about and then plan a rough layout of the game before you start programming.
All games must have a name and a beginning, when the game ends you must have the choice to start again.
